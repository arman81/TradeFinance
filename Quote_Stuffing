Quote stufing is a form of nefarious activity in which a high frequency traders base on the market feed data.
In this high frequency trader stuffs a channel with bogus quotes to sort of jam the channel much like a Denial Of Service Attack in Computer Networks.
This act devoids other traders/investors to see the market data feed of other instruments whose bogus quotes have been stuffed on the channel.

The high frequency traders take benefit of situtations in such a way that they capture stale orders of certains instruments,buy these instruments
at a much lower rate and then sell these instruments at a much higher rate later on.
