While working in the Trade Finance domain over the past 1+year I have observed a pattern in the market movement and have identified 
best months of the year to take maximum advantage out these months and trade heavy to yield max profit.

May- a lot of buying happens in this month by big market players on the instruments they want to hold for the rest of the summer
probably before going to summer vacation.

April to August excluding May is usually bearish until and unless there is a major political,natural,geographical event take place.


Mid August to September comes with generally bullish market and a significant amount of market movement is usually observed in these 
months.
Late September is usually accompanied by more market movement generally market goind downwards and this situation can be greatly 
leveraged by techniques such as short selling,providind liquidity by market making strategies in time of panic selling.
Probable reason is that lot of mutual funds,market players,investors close their position in this month of the instruments they
have been holding since summer


October-November - This is the wide known fact that these are festive months in India and lot of market movement is seen pre festivals and a significant market movement is observed post Diwali i.e the great Indian festival
Also US market historically has seen a rapid rise in the market in the month of November,Maybe cos of the reason that this is the starting of the fiscal year for many mutual funds and they have capital to invest in the beginning month of the fiscal year.

January - This month naturally brings market movement along with it with the beginning of new year.

Febraury - Many companies post their performance in this month and budget of many countries is also presented in this month,
if the health of the global economy is good,this month generally observe a lot of market movement.
